## 246. Strobogrammatic Number

### Question
Given a string num which represents an integer, return true if num is a strobogrammatic number.

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

 

Example 1:

Input: num = "69"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: num = "88"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: num = "962"
Output: false
Example 4:

Input: num = "1"
Output: true

### Solutions
### Solution1: Hashmap
```
class Solution:
    def isStrobogrammatic(self, num: str) -> bool:
        hashmap = {'0': '0', '1': '1', '6': '9', '9': '6', '8': '8'}
        check = []
        for i in reversed(num):
            if (i not in hashmap):
                return False
            else:
                check.append(hashmap[i])
        rotated_String = "".join(check)
        return (rotated_String == num)
       #Time: O(N) Space: O(N)
```
Points
1. reversed() 返回一个反转的迭代器。[https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-func-reversed.html]
2. check\[::-1]: 返回反转list
### Solution2: Two Pointers
```
class Solution:
    def isStrobogrammatic(self, num: str) -> bool:
        hashmap = {'0': '0', '1': '1', '6': '9', '9': '6', '8': '8'}
        left = 0
        right = len(num) - 1
        while left <= right:
            if num[left] not in hashmap:
                return False
            elif hashmap[num[left]] != num[right]:
                return False
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        return True
        #Time: O(n/2) Space: O(1)
```

## 1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences
### Question
Given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: String is already palindrome
Example 2:

Input: s = "abb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".
Example 3:

Input: s = "baabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
Example 4:

Input: s = ""
Output: 0

### Solution1:
```
class Solution:
    def removePalindromeSub(self, s: str) -> int:
        if not s:
            return 0
        if s == s[::-1]:
            return 1
        return 2
        #Time: O(N) Space: O(N)
```
```
return 0 if len(s) == 0 else 1 if s == s[::-1] else 2
```
## 12. Integer to Roman
### Question
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
Example 2:

Input: num = 4
Output: "IV"
Example 3:

Input: num = 9
Output: "IX"
Example 4:

Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
Example 5:

Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= num <= 3999

### Solution1 Greedy
```
digits = [(1000, "M"), (900, "CM"), (500, "D"), (400, "CD"), (100, "C"), 
                  (90, "XC"), (50, "L"), (40, "XL"), (10, "X"), (9, "IX"), 
                  (5, "V"), (4, "IV"), (1, "I")]
        roman = ""
        
        for value, symbol in digits:
            
            if num == 0: break
            count, num = divmod(num, value)
            roman += count * symbol
        return roman
        # Time: O(1), Space: O(1)
```
Point: divmod() 返回一个包含商和余数的元组(a // b, a % b)

### Solution2 Hardcode Digits
``` 
class Solution:
    def intToRoman(self, num: int) -> str:
        thousands = ["", "M", "MM", "MMM"]
        hundreds = ["", "C", "CC", "CCC", "CD", "D", "DC", "DCC", "DCCC", "CM"]
        tens = ["", "X", "XX", "XXX", "XL", "L", "LX", "LXX", "LXXX", "XC"]
        ones = ["", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "VII", "VIII", "IX"]
        return (thousands[num // 1000] + hundreds[num % 1000 // 100] 
               + tens[num % 100 // 10] + ones[num % 10])
               # Time: O(1), Space: O(1)
```
O(1), O(1)
