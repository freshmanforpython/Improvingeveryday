## 246. Strobogrammatic Number

### Question
Given a string num which represents an integer, return true if num is a strobogrammatic number.

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

 

Example 1:

Input: num = "69"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: num = "88"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: num = "962"
Output: false
Example 4:

Input: num = "1"
Output: true

### Solutions
### Solution1: Hashmap
```
class Solution:
    def isStrobogrammatic(self, num: str) -> bool:
        hashmap = {'0': '0', '1': '1', '6': '9', '9': '6', '8': '8'}
        check = []
        for i in reversed(num):
            if (i not in hashmap):
                return False
            else:
                check.append(hashmap[i])
        rotated_String = "".join(check)
        return (rotated_String == num)
       #Time: O(N) Space: O(N)
```
Points
1. reversed() 返回一个反转的迭代器。[https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-func-reversed.html]
2. check\[::-1]: 返回反转list
### Solution2: Two Pointers
```
class Solution:
    def isStrobogrammatic(self, num: str) -> bool:
        hashmap = {'0': '0', '1': '1', '6': '9', '9': '6', '8': '8'}
        left = 0
        right = len(num) - 1
        while left <= right:
            if num[left] not in hashmap:
                return False
            elif hashmap[num[left]] != num[right]:
                return False
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        return True
        #Time: O(n/2) Space: O(1)
```

## 1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences
### Question
Given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: String is already palindrome
Example 2:

Input: s = "abb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".
Example 3:

Input: s = "baabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
Example 4:

Input: s = ""
Output: 0

### Solution1:
```
class Solution:
    def removePalindromeSub(self, s: str) -> int:
        if not s:
            return 0
        if s == s[::-1]:
            return 1
        return 2
        #Time: O(N) Space: O(N)
```
```
return 0 if len(s) == 0 else 1 if s == s[::-1] else 2
```
## 12. Integer to Roman
### Question
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
Example 2:

Input: num = 4
Output: "IV"
Example 3:

Input: num = 9
Output: "IX"
Example 4:

Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
Example 5:

Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= num <= 3999

### Solution1 Greedy
```
digits = [(1000, "M"), (900, "CM"), (500, "D"), (400, "CD"), (100, "C"), 
                  (90, "XC"), (50, "L"), (40, "XL"), (10, "X"), (9, "IX"), 
                  (5, "V"), (4, "IV"), (1, "I")]
        roman = ""
        
        for value, symbol in digits:
            
            if num == 0: break
            count, num = divmod(num, value)
            roman += count * symbol
        return roman
        # Time: O(1), Space: O(1)
```
Point: divmod() 返回一个包含商和余数的元组(a // b, a % b)

### Solution2 Hardcode Digits
``` 
class Solution:
    def intToRoman(self, num: int) -> str:
        thousands = ["", "M", "MM", "MMM"]
        hundreds = ["", "C", "CC", "CCC", "CD", "D", "DC", "DCC", "DCCC", "CM"]
        tens = ["", "X", "XX", "XXX", "XL", "L", "LX", "LXX", "LXXX", "XC"]
        ones = ["", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "VII", "VIII", "IX"]
        return (thousands[num // 1000] + hundreds[num % 1000 // 100] 
               + tens[num % 100 // 10] + ones[num % 10])
               # Time: O(1), Space: O(1)
```
O(1), O(1)

## 1461. Check If a String Contains All Binary Codes of Size K
### Question
Given a binary string s and an integer k.

Return True if every binary code of length k is a substring of s. Otherwise, return False.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "00110110", k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: The binary codes of length 2 are "00", "01", "10" and "11". They can be all found as substrings at indicies 0, 1, 3 and 2 respectively.
Example 2:

Input: s = "00110", k = 2
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: s = "0110", k = 1
Output: true
Explanation: The binary codes of length 1 are "0" and "1", it is clear that both exist as a substring. 
Example 4:

Input: s = "0110", k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The binary code "00" is of length 2 and doesn't exist in the array.
Example 5:

Input: s = "0000000001011100", k = 4
Output: false

### Solution1: Set
```
class Solution:
    def hasAllCodes(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:
        need = 1 << k
        got = set()

        for i in range(k, len(s)+1):
            tmp = s[i-k:i]
            if tmp not in got:
                got.add(tmp)
                need -= 1
                # return True when found all occurrences
                if need == 0:
                    return True
        return False
```

### Solution2: Rolling Hash
For example, say s="11010110", and k=3, and we just finish calculating the hash of the first substring: "110" (hash is 4+2=6, or 110). Now we want to know the next hash, which is the hash of "101".

We can start from the binary form of our hash, which is 110. First, we shift left, resulting 1100. We do not need the first digit, so it is a good idea to do 1100 & 111 = 100. The all-one 111 helps us to align the digits. Now we need to apply the lowest digit of "101", which is 1, to our hash, and by using |, we get 100 | last_digit = 100 | 1 = 101.
```
class Solution:
    def hasAllCodes(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:
        need = 1 << k
        got = [False]*need
        all_one = need - 1
        hash_val = 0

        for i in range(len(s)):
            # calculate hash for s[i-k+1:i+1]
            hash_val = ((hash_val << 1) & all_one) | (int(s[i]))
            # hash only available when i-k+1 > 0
            if i >= k-1 and got[hash_val] is False:
                got[hash_val] = True
                need -= 1
                if need == 0:
                    return True
        return False
```
Points:
1. Rolling hash
2. i << k: 将i的二进制左移k位
3. a & b: 二进制与
4. a | b: 二进制或 [https://www.runoob.com/python/python-operators.html]

## 1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal
### Question
You are given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length. A string swap is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.

Return true if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of the strings. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"
Output: true
Explanation: For example, swap the first character with the last character of s2 to make "bank".
Example 2:

Input: s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make them equal with one string swap.
Example 3:

Input: s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"
Output: true
Explanation: The two strings are already equal, so no string swap operation is required.
Example 4:

Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "dcba"
Output: false
### Intuition
### Solution
```
class Solution:
    def areAlmostEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        diff = [[x, y] for x, y in zip(s1, s2) if x != y]
        return not diff or len(diff) == 2 and diff[0][::-1] == diff[1]
```
Points:
1. zip(a, b)
