## 823. Binary Trees With Factors
### Question
Given an array of unique integers, arr, where each integer arr[i] is strictly greater than 1.

We make a binary tree using these integers, and each number may be used for any number of times. Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of its children.

Return the number of binary trees we can make. The answer may be too large so return the answer modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [4, 2, 2]
Example 2:

Input: arr = [2,4,5,10]
Output: 7
Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [5], [10], [4, 2, 2], [10, 2, 5], [10, 5, 2].
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 1000
2 <= arr[i] <= 109

### Solution
```class Solution(object):
    def numFactoredBinaryTrees(self, A):
        MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
        N = len(A)
        A.sort()
        dp = [1] * N
        index = {x: i for i, x in enumerate(A)}
        for i, x in enumerate(A):
            for j in xrange(i):
                if x % A[j] == 0: #A[j] will be left child
                    right = x / A[j]
                    if right in index:
                        dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[index[right]]
                        dp[i] %= MOD

        return sum(dp) % MOD
```
Points:
1. 10**\9+7: It's the largest and simplest prime number close to MAX LONG. 
    (The largest integer data type in C/C++ is unsigned long long int which is of 64 bit and can handle integer from 0 to (2^64 â€“ 1))
