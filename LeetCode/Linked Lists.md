# Questions
## [61. Rotate List](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/)
### Question
Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
Example 2:


Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
0 <= k <= 2 * 109

### Algorithm
1. Find the old tail and connect it with the head old_tail.next = head to close the ring. Compute the length of the list n at the same time.

2. Find the new tail, which is (n - k % n - 1)th node from the head and the new head, which is (n - k % n)th node.

3. Break the ring new_tail.next = None and return new_head.

### Answer
```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        if not head:
            return None
        if not head.next:
            return head
        
        # close the linked list into the ring
        old_tail = head
        n = 1
        while old_tail.next:
            old_tail = old_tail.next
            n += 1
        old_tail.next = head
        
        # find new tail: (n - k % n - 1)th node
        # and new head: (n - k % n)th node
        new_tail = head
        for i in range(n - k % n - 1):
            new_tail = new_tail.next
        new_head = new_tail.next
        
        # break the ring
        new_tail.next = None
        
        return new_head
```
## [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)
### Question
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

 

Example 1:


Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

### Algorithm
1. 高精度加法
2. 指针
3. special cases:
1) two numbers with different lengths
2) sum has more digits

### Solution
```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        result = ListNode(0)
        result_tail = result
        carry = 0
        
        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            val1 = (l1.val if l1 else 0)
            val2 = (l2.val if l2 else 0)
            carry, out = divmod(val1+val2+carry, 10)
            
            result_tail.next = ListNode(out)
            result_tail = result_tail.next
            
            l1 = (l1.next if l1 else None)
            l2 = (l2.next if l2 else None)
            
        return result.next
```
